\begin{description}
\item[Straightforward:] Virtio devices use normal bus mechanisms of
  interrupts and DMA which should be familiar to any device driver
  author. There is no exotic page-flipping or COW mechanism: it's just
  a normal device.\footnote{This lack of page-sharing implies that the implementation of the
device (e.g. the hypervisor or host) needs full access to the
guest memory. Communication with untrusted parties (i.e.
inter-guest communication) requires copying.
}

\item[Efficient:] Virtio devices consist of rings of descriptors
  for both input and output, which are neatly laid out to avoid cache
  effects from both driver and device writing to the same cache
  lines.

\item[Standard:] Virtio makes no assumptions about the environment in which
  it operates, beyond supporting the bus to which device is attached.
  In this specification, virtio
  devices are implemented over MMIO, Channel I/O and PCI bus transports
\footnote{The Linux implementation further separates the virtio
transport code from the specific virtio drivers: these drivers are shared
between different transports.
}, earlier drafts
  have been implemented on other buses not included here.

\item[Extensible:] Virtio devices contain feature bits which are
  acknowledged by the guest operating system during device setup.
  This allows forwards and backwards compatibility: the device
  offers all the features it knows about, and the driver
  acknowledges those it understands and wishes to use.

\section{Terminology}\label{Terminology}

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in \hyperref[intro:rfc2119]{[RFC2119]}.

An older specification (see \hyperref[intro:Virtio PCI Draft]{[Virtio PCI Draft]}) defined a
similar, but different interface between the hypervisor and the guest.
To simplify transition and note differences, the following terms are used:

\begin{description}
\item[Legacy Interface]
        An interface specified by \hyperref[intro:Virtio PCI Draft]{[Virtio PCI Draft]}.
\item[Legacy Device]
        A device which implements \hyperref[intro:Virtio PCI Draft]{[Virtio PCI Draft]}, but not this specification.
\item[Legacy Driver]
        A driver which implements \hyperref[intro:Virtio PCI Draft]{[Virtio PCI Draft]}, but not this specification. 
\item[Transitional Device]
        A device which implements both this specification and the older
        \hyperref[intro:Virtio PCI Draft]{[Virtio PCI Draft]}
        specification, thus allowing legacy drivers.
\item[Transitional Driver]
        A device which implements both this specification and the older
        \hyperref[intro:Virtio PCI Draft]{[Virtio PCI Draft]}
        specification, thus allowing legacy devices.
\item[Non-Transitional Device]
        A device which does not implement the
        \hyperref[intro:Virtio PCI Draft]{[Virtio PCI Draft]} specification.
\item[Non-Transitional Driver]
        A driver which does not implement the
        \hyperref[intro:Virtio PCI Draft]{[Virtio PCI Draft]} specification.

\section{Structure Specifications}

Many device and driver in-memory structure layouts are documented using
the C struct syntax. All structures are assumed to be without additional
padding. To stress this, cases where common C compilers are known to insert
extra padding within structures are tagged using the GNU C
__attribute__((packed))  syntax.

For the integer data types used in the structure definitions, the following
conventions are used:

\begin{description}
\item[u8, u16, u32, u64] An unsigned integer of the specified length in bits.

\item[le16, le32, le64] An unsigned integer of the specified length in bits,
in little-endian byte order.

\item[be16, be32, be64] An unsigned integer of the specified length in bits,
in big-endian byte order.
